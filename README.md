# Emerging Project 2020
<br>
### Introduction
*************
Describe about the Project?????

### Technology
*******************
Flask
Tensorflow
Keras

### Design of Project
*******************

## Breakdown Steps
*******************
* 1: Create a Web Service that uses machine learning 

* 2: Design a Model to make pre-dictions based on the data set (powerproduction)

* 3: Goal is to Produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine outpus(Wind Speed Values from the data set)

* 4: Then develop a Web service that will respond with the predicted power values basesd on speed values(HTTP requests)

## Procedure
*******************
*  Jupyter Notebook that trains a model using the data set

* 2: Python script that runs the web service based on the model

* 3: Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container

* 4: Then the ReadMe

### How to Run
*******************

### Conclusion
*******************

## Marking Scheme
* 25% Research 
* 25% Development
* 25% Consistency
* 25% Documentation
