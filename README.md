# Emerging Project 2020

## Breakdown Steps
### 1: Create a Web Service that uses machine learning to make pre-dictions based on the data set (powerproduction)

### 2: Some of the Above

### 3: Goal is to Produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine outpus(Wind Speed Values from the data set)

### 4: Then develop a Web service that will respond with the predicted power values basesd on speed values(HTTP requests)


## Procedure
### 1: Jupyter Notebook that trains a model using the data set

### 2: Python script that runs the web service based on the model

### 3: Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container

### 4: Then the ReadMe

## Marking Scheme
### 25% Research 
### 25% Development
### 25% Consistency
### 25% Documentation
